# Weekly vitamins for COMS2001 #

**These are quick questions for you to consider every week as you go
   through the course.  They are meant to check your understanding of
   the basic material covered in the course, and sometimes encourage
   you to do a little bit of extra thinking and research on your
   own.**

*As you mother might have taught you, vitamins are good for you!*
