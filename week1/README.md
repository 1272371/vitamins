1. Why there are no heap and stack segments in the executable file?

2. When an executable file is loaded into memory and a process is
   created, what are the initial contents of the heap and the stack
   segments of the address space?  Why?

3. When a C program gets compiled, the unitialised global variables
   get initialised to 0, while local variables start off uninitialised.
   Why?

4. We said that the only piece of harware that a running user program
   can communicate with directly, without going through the OS, is the
   CPU.  Is this actually true? -- Is a user program's access to the
   CPU direct or mediated somehow?  Justify your answer.

5. Explain how the OS makes sure that malicious processes cannot
   interfere with the other processes running on the machine at the
   same time.
